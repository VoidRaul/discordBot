This Bot will create event and on user reaction to his message he will add people

the bot will create the event with the following command

!create "title_of_the_event"description_of_the_event"

for a correct funtionality i reccomend to use the emoji ðŸ‘Œ that is the basic emoji of discord

You will need to create a data.py with inside the current data

TOKEN = 'WITH-YOUR-BOT-TOKEN'
admin ='WITH-THE-ADMIN-ID'
color_n=0xFF0000  --->THIS IS RED COLOR BUT YOU CAN USE WHAT YOU LIKE
presenze='HOW YOU WAT TO CALL PRESENCE'
channel_id_ascolto1='CHANNEL ID WHERE THE BOT WILL OPERATE'
channel_id_ascolto2='CHANNEL ID WHERE THE BOT WILL OPERATE'
operator='WHO IS PARTECIPATING A NAME TO REPPRESENT WHO IS IN THE LIST'
emoti='ðŸ‘Œ'
